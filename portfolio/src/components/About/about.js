                        I'm a Full-Stack Software Developer based in Miami, FL and Boston, MA. 
                        Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking high mountains, learning japanese, binge watching anime, practicing yoga, and capoeira flipping.
                        <br/>
                        My work is entirely responsive and is inspired by seamless navigation, soft animation, and clean UI.
                        {/* I'm truly passionate about making the world a better place with <span className="highlight">Tech</span>, <span className="highlight">Innovation</span>, and <span className="highlight">Open-Source</span>,
